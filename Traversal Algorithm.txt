Tree Traversal can often be regard as a process of reading/processing data in each node in the tree exactly once in some order.

Depth first traversal
In each node, we will process all its children before its grand-children
we first process the root, then the left sub-tree followed by the right sub-tree
<root><left>right>

Algorithm.
1. Determine the root of the tree.
2. Determine the number of nodes/branches of the root.
3. loop over the main branches one after the other
4. Visit all the nodes in the selected branch recursively
